I'm Karan. I aim to do work that brings meaningful change. I currently work at Aryn, a document intelligence startup, where I've built and led the development of AI applications, worked with customers on integrating novel workflows, and trained and launched new architectures. I am particularly interested and experienced in multimodal AI, due to its wide ranging applications and positioning for the next phase of AI development.

I love building in the open, and taking ideas -> products in a 0 to 1 process. To reach out, email me at me@karansampath.com
